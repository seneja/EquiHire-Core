> **"Evaluating Code, Not Context."**

**EquiHire** is an AI-driven intermediary layer for technical recruitment. It intercepts live audio from candidates during technical interviews, sanitizes their identity (voice, accent, and PII) in real-time using a hybrid microservices architecture, and presents recruiters with a purely semantic text stream. This ensures hiring decisions are based solely on technical merit, effectively acting as a firewall against unconscious bias.

## 🚩 The Problem
Technical recruitment is plagued by unconscious biases that "Blind Hiring" tools fail to solve:
1.  **The Accent Penalty:** Candidates with non-native accents are subconsciously rated lower on technical competence.
2.  **Contextual Bias:** Hiring managers favor candidates from specific universities or demographics based on visual/auditory cues.
3.  **The "Black Box" Rejection:** Rejected candidates rarely receive explainable feedback on *why* they failed.

## 💡 The Solution
EquiHire replaces the video call with a **Sanitized Real-Time Data Stream**.
1.  **Audio Interception:** We capture the candidate's voice via Twilio Media Streams.
2.  **AI Sanitization:**
    * **Whisper AI** transcribes audio to text (removing accent bias).
    * **Fine-Tuned BERT** redacts PII like Names, Schools, and Locations (removing contextual bias).
3.  **Explainable Feedback (XAI):** Our engine analyzes the gap between the candidate's answers and the job description to generate a "Growth Report" post-interview.

## 🏗 System Architecture
EquiHire utilizes a **Cloud-Native Hybrid Microservices** pattern hosted on **WSO2 Choreo**.



* **Service A: The Gateway (Ballerina)** 🟢
    * Handles high-concurrency WebSockets from Twilio.
    * Manages Authentication (Asgardeo) and Database Logging.
    * Routes traffic between the User and the AI Engine.
* **Service B: The Brain (Python/FastAPI)** 🐍
    * Hosts the AI Models (Whisper, BERT, Scikit-Learn).
    * Processes raw audio chunks and returns sanitized JSON.
* **Service C: The Dashboard (React + Vite)** ⚛️
    * Real-time "Blind" Dashboard for recruiters.
    * Audio-visualizer portal for candidates.

## 🔐 Identity Lifecycle (Asgardeo Integration)

Here is the step-by-step workflow of how the Interviewer (Recruiter) and Candidate interact, specifically focusing on how **WSO2 Asgardeo** handles the Identity and Access Management (IAM) behind the scenes.

### Phase 1: The Setup (Organization Creation)
Before any interview happens, the company must exist in the system.

1.  **The Sign-Up:**
    *   **Action:** The Lead Recruiter (Admin) visits the web portal and clicks "Sign Up for Enterprise."
    *   **Asgardeo's Role:**
        *   The app redirects to the Asgardeo Login Page.
        *   The Admin can use SSO (Single Sign-On). For example, if they work at WSO2, they sign in with their corporate Microsoft/Google account.
        *   **Tech:** Asgardeo verifies the corporate credentials via OIDC (OpenID Connect).

2.  **Organization Provisioning:**
    *   **Action:** Once logged in, the Admin creates their organization profile: "Virtusa - Tech Hiring Team".
    *   **Asgardeo's Role:** EquiHire assigns this user the "Organization Admin" role in Asgardeo. This gives them permission to invite other recruiters.

### Phase 2: The Recruiter's Journey (Creating the Interview)
Now the recruiter is logged in and ready to hire.

1.  **Login:**
    *   **Action:** Mr. Perera (Recruiter) logs in using his company email.
    *   **Asgardeo:** Authenticates him and returns a JWT (JSON Web Token). This token contains a claim: `role: "RECRUITER"`.
    *   **EquiHire Backend:** Checks the token. "Okay, this is Mr. Perera from Virtusa. Show him the Virtusa Dashboard."

2.  **Scheduling the Session:**
    *   **Action:** He clicks "New Session" on the dashboard.
    *   **Input:** Job Role (Senior Python Engineer), Candidate Email (sarah.j@gmail.com), Date/Time.
    *   **The Trigger:** When he clicks "Send Invite," the Ballerina Gateway wakes up.

### Phase 3: The "Magic" Invitation (Asgardeo Integration)
This is the most critical part for User Experience. Candidates should NOT have to create a complex account with a password.

1.  **Backend Logic (Ballerina):**
    *   The Ballerina service receives the request: "Invite sarah.j@gmail.com."
    *   It calls the Asgardeo **SCIM 2.0 API** (System for Cross-domain Identity Management).
    *   **Command:** "Create a temporary user for Sarah."

2.  **The "Magic Link" Dispatch:**
    *   **Asgardeo's Role:** It generates a Passwordless Login Link (or a One-Time Code).
    *   **Email:** Asgardeo (or your Ballerina service via an Email SDK) sends an email to Sarah: *"You have been invited to a Blind Interview with [Company Redacted]. Click here to join."*

### Phase 4: The Candidate's Journey (The Login)
Sarah receives the email.

1.  **The Click:**
    *   **Action:** Sarah clicks the link in her email.
    *   **Asgardeo's Role:**
        *   The link redirects her to Asgardeo.
        *   Asgardeo verifies the unique token in the URL. **No password required.**
        *   It redirects her back to the EquiHire Candidate Portal.

2.  **The "Waiting Room" (Lobby):**
    *   **Action:** Sarah lands on the "Mic Test" page.
    *   **Security:**
        *   The React App holds a Candidate Access Token.
        *   This token has restricted permissions: `scope: "candidate_view"`.
        *   She cannot see the Recruiter's dashboard. She cannot see other candidates.

### Phase 5: The Interview (The Connection)
The connection is established.

1.  **Connecting to the Room:**
    *   **Action:** Sarah clicks "Join Interview."
    *   **Ballerina Gateway:**
        *   It checks her Token: "Is this Sarah? Is she scheduled for this time?"
        *   **Verification Success:** It opens the WebSocket Audio Stream.

2.  **The End of the Session:**
    *   **Action:** The interview finishes.
    *   **Asgardeo:** The "Guest Session" expires. If Sarah tries to click the link again tomorrow, it will say "Link Expired." This prevents unauthorized access.

### Summary of Roles

| Actor | Asgardeo Feature Used | Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recruiter** | Enterprise SSO (OIDC) | Logs in with Company Email (Gmail/Outlook). Setup is permanent. |
| **Candidate** | Passwordless Login (Magic Link) | No registration form. No "Forgot Password." Just one click to enter. |
| **System** | RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) | Ensures Candidates can't see grading sheets and Recruiters can't see the Candidate's real name until the end. |

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 AI Capabilities

* **Context-Aware Transcription:**
* **Engine:** OpenAI Whisper (API Mode).
* **Innovation:** Implements "Context Priming" by injecting a glossary of Sri Lankan technical terms (e.g., "Moratuwa", "HND", "Batch Top") into the prompt to resolve accent ambiguities and eliminate hallucinations.

* **Real-Time Redaction (The Firewall):**
* **Engine:** Fine-Tuned BERT (`bert-base-ner`).
* **Innovation:** Specifically fine-tuned on a custom dataset of Sri Lankan entities to detect and mask local PII (e.g., `[School]`, `[Location]`, `[Religion]`) that standard models miss.

* **Deterministic Scoring (The Judge):**
* **Engine:** Scikit-Learn (Cosine Similarity & TF-IDF).
* **Innovation:** Converts candidate answers and job descriptions into vector space to calculate a mathematically provable "Relevance Score," ensuring grading is objective and free from LLM hallucinations.

* **Generative Feedback & Auditor (The Safety Valve):**
* **Engine:** **Google Gemini**.
* **Innovation:** Acts as a dual-layer system:
1. **Narrator:** Converts raw Scikit-Learn scores into human-readable "Growth Reports" for rejected candidates.
2. **Auditor:** Performs a secondary "Safety Check" on transcripts to flag subtle PII that the BERT model might have missed before the recruiter sees the text.
