# EquiHire-Core: The 3-Stage Cognitive Bias Firewall

**"Evaluating Code, Not Context."**

EquiHire is an AI-driven intermediary layer for technical recruitment. It transforms the traditional "Resume Black Hole" into a transparent, bias-free **3-Stage Hiring Funnel**. It intercepts live audio from candidates, sanitizes their identity in real-time, and presents recruiters with a purely semantic text stream.

## The Problem
Technical recruitment is broken:
1.  **Volume vs. Quality:** Recruiters are overwhelmed by hundreds of CVs, often "auto-rejecting" good candidates based on keywords.
2.  **The Accent Penalty:** Candidates with non-native accents are subconsciously rated lower on technical competence.
3.  **Contextual Bias:** Hiring managers favor candidates from specific universities or demographics.

## The Solution: 3-Stage Funnel

EquiHire implements a **3-Stage Hiring Funnel** to filter noise and bias efficiently.

### Stage 1: The Automated Gatekeeper (Filter)
*   **Goal:** Instant reject of unqualified candidates.
*   **Action:** Candidates upload their CV to a specific Job ID.
*   **Agent:** The system automatically parses the PDF (securely in Cloudflare R2) and checks against "Must-Have Skills" (e.g., "Django", "Python").
*   **Result:** Only candidates meeting the hard requirements move to Stage 2.

### Stage 2: The Asynchronous AI Screener (Score)
*   **Goal:** Test technical knowledge without using human time.
*   **Action:** Passing candidates receive a "Start Screening" link (Voice/Text).
*   **Agent:** An AI agent asks 3 technical screening questions defined by the recruiter.
*   **Result:** Top-scoring candidates are Shortlisted for the Live Interview.

### Stage 3: The Live Blind Interview (The Bias Firewall)
*   **Goal:** Deep technical culture check (Bias-Free).
*   **Action:** Use **EquiHire Live** for the interview.
*   **The Firewall:**
    *   **Audio Interception:** We capture the candidate's voice.
    *   **AI Sanitization:** Real-time transcription + BERT-NER redaction remove names, locations, and schools.
    *   **Recruiter View:** Sees only technical merit in a text stream.

## System Architecture

EquiHire utilizes a cloud-native hybrid microservices pattern.

### 1. The Gateway (Ballerina)
-   **Orchestrator:** Manages the entire funnel (Jobs, Candidates, status updates).
-   **Secure Uploads:** Generates presigned URLs for direct Cloudflare R2 uploads.
-   **Enforcer:** Routes audio to OpenAI and text to the Python Firewall.
-   **Endpoints:** `POST /jobs`, `POST /candidates/complete-upload`.

### 2. The Intelligence Engine (Python/FastAPI)
-   **The Matcher:** Executes the Stage 1 filtering logic (Skills matching).
-   **The Firewall:** Hosts the BERT-NER model for real-time redaction.
-   **The Vault Keymaster:** Manages Cloudflare R2 credentials and secure reveals.
-   **Integration:** Updates results directly to **Supabase**.

### 3. The Dashboard (React + Vite)
-   Real-time "Blind" Dashboard for recruiters receiving only sanitized text.
-   Candidate portal for microphone access and interview joining.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/EquiHire-Core.git

3.  **Backend Gateway (Ballerina)**
    ```bash
    cd ballerina-gateway
    cp Config.toml.example Config.toml
    # IMPORTANT: Update Config.toml with your keys.
    # Note: R2 'accessKeyId' is a string ID, not a URL.
    bal run
    ```

4.  **AI Intelligence Engine (Python)**
    
    > **Recommendation:** We strongly recommend using **Miniforge Conda** to manage the Python environment.

    ```bash
    cd python-ai-engine

    # 1. Create the environment (Python 3.11)
    conda create --name EquiHire-Core python=3.11 -y

    # 2. Activate the environment
    conda activate EquiHire-Core

    # 3. Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # 4. Configure Environment Variables
    cp .env.example .env
    # Update .env with:
    # - OPENAI_API_KEY
    # - R2 Credentials
    # - SUPABASE_URL & SUPABASE_KEY
    
    # 5. Run the Engine
    # Option A: Direct uvicorn
    uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
    
    # Option B: Via Python module (if command not found)
    python -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
    ```

5.  **Frontend (React)**
    ```bash
    cd react-frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

EquiHire is an AI-driven intermediary layer for technical recruitment. It intercepts live audio from candidates during technical interviews, sanitizes their identity (voice, accent, and PII) in real-time using a hybrid microservices architecture, and presents recruiters with a purely semantic text stream. This ensures hiring decisions are based solely on technical merit, effectively acting as a firewall against unconscious bias.

## The Problem
Technical recruitment is plagued by unconscious biases that "Blind Hiring" tools fail to solve:
1.  **The Accent Penalty:** Candidates with non-native accents are subconsciously rated lower on technical competence.
2.  **Contextual Bias:** Hiring managers favor candidates from specific universities or demographics based on visual/auditory cues.
3.  **The "Black Box" Rejection:** Rejected candidates rarely receive explainable feedback on why they failed.

## The Solution
EquiHire replaces the video call with a **Sanitized Real-Time Data Stream**.
1.  **Audio Interception:** We capture the candidate's voice via Twilio Media Streams (or Browser WebSocket).
2.  **AI Sanitization (The Firewall):**
    -   **OpenAI Realtime API** handles low-latency transcription.
    -   **Fine-Tuned BERT** performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) to redact PII (Names, Schools, Locations) *before* the recruiter sees the text.
3.  **Secure CV Vault:**
    -   **Cloudflare R2** acts as a private vault for original resumes.
    -   **Blind Parsing**: AI extracts skills without exposing the file.
    -   **On-Demand Reveal**: Recruiters can only unlock the original PDF via a temporary (5-minute) signed link.
4.  **Explainable Feedback (XAI):** Our engine analyzes the gap between the candidate's answers and the job description to generate a "Growth Report" post-interview.
